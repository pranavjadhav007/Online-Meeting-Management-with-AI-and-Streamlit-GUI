    post_meeting_transcript="""Hello everyone. So shall we start todays meeting. Ok we will start after 5 min. Wait for five minutes. Let everyone join. Is everyone ready now. Ok. So myself Nachiket Jape. Today we will be discussing about the company progress. Or whatever things you have done in last few weeks. So anyone want to start. Hello sir myself Saurabh Jaiswal. We are getting lot of problems with the EC2 machine. The cloud infrastructure need to be fixed. Its not able to handle lot of traffic. Every time it crosses 10k users. It crashes. It will be good If you tell rohit to look into it and fix the issue. Ok so Rohit are you there. Yes Sir. So rohit check the cloud infrastructure. Sir I think the users are so much that the virtual machine is not able to handle it. I think if we upgrade the instance then it will be solved. Ok do it then. Hello sir. Myself Basant. I think we should open our new centre in Pune as thereâ€™s lot infrastructure and also we can manage the traffic routing there. Himanshu lives there. So I think it will be good if he can do more research for the exact location. I think Ayush is good in this work. So ayush you go and check the location. See if Pune fits for us. Ok will look into it. Sir the customer are getting lots of queries. I think we should make a team for it. It will be very helpful. It can benefit our customer relationship and will also help to keep us in the market. Ok. Dhruv look into this customer support. Do it as soon as possible. Anyone want to say anything more. Ok then meet you all in the next meeting. Thank you. Bye. Bye sir. Bye sir."""
